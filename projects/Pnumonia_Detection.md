## 1. Abstract

In this project,  

## 2. Introdiction

In Bangladesh, pneumonia is responsible for around 28% of the deaths of children under five years of age. An estimated 80,000 children under five years of age are admitted to hospital with virus-associated acute respiratory illness each year; the total number of infections is likely to be much higher [(icddr,b)](https://www.icddrb.org/news-and-events/press-corner/media-resources/pneumonia-and-other-respiratory-diseases). Bangladesh is a very densely populated country. There is a shortage of expert radiology in bangladesh. It would be very helpful if there is a system on the internet that can detect Pneumonia automatically.  We create web-based deep learning method that can take a Chest X-picture and give some probability about the Pneumonia of a patient. This early detecting method can save a lot of time and help to respond quickly.
