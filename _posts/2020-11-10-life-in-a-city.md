I was not writing for/to anyone mainly. I was sitting down to write my thought, like to capture the time or something. 


For 11 months I was living in this city. The last time I am here it was not a very pleasant experience for me back then. Leaving a city is hard, especially where people rarely trust each other. Someday ago I was going to help a woman on the bus, she seems afraid. Modern society is based on trust. The system of money is trust. But it's very hard to live in a city where there is very low trust in each other. It makes you isolated, defend. I think that's why boys and girls in the city tend to look for relation more and take it very seriously. Not because they love each other(First love means generosity of interpretation), it's because they are lonely deep down inside. They want to skip it by some kind of illusion. 

One other problem is modern life. When a society/system grows more and more, it quantizes its work into part by part and wants to make specialize out of it. specialize doctor, engineer, cooker so on, and so forth. But the problem of this is, you can't relate to anything bigger part if you do like this. If you sell eggs all day in the city it's good but it's a very small part of other human life. it's hard to make a deep connection out of. I think that what modern life suffer is lack of deep connection not the number of connection. 

Another thing about the city is it's always an extremely fun, extremely sad, extreme journey. It's very hard to give yourself a little time to know what he wants. Everyone is doing busy saving themself, they don't bother to sacrifice others for it. Here survival is the mantra, kinship is secondary. Another problem with the city is some kind of people where they think they know but they are in illusion. 


Another thing to mention is there is an extreme class imbalance here. Everyone thing they are unhappy but the majority of people work hard and suffer more than them. The problem I think that they don't have want they want. Rater than they are not simple enough to see what should be looking for. 


But despite this I was hopeful about the city, if you want to find people for the connection you will find them and you will see they are as long as you are. At first, they will be terrified(who won't, what is the proof you're a good person?). But remember once they understand you find a different person. They are just trying to survive like you are. Maybe they are good as you are. They just can't look at you because they are in pain or busy or just on some busy road in this city right now. :)
